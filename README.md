### Project Title
Bikeshare -  Udacity Project

### Description
This project is designed to be easily run from the terminal and allows users to seamlessly perform exploratory analysis on bikeshare data from three major US cities: Chicago, New York City, and Washington. This program contains an interactive filtering tool that allows users to filter the data by city, day, and month. The built in functions allow the user to easily perform exploratory data analysis from most popular start and end destinations to basic user demographics like gender.

### Files used
- bikeshare_2.py

### Contribution
There are some steps to this project currently still in development; particularly writing functions for the descriptive statistics that we would like to provide for users. Please reach out to Ashley Casavant on GitHub for more information if you are interested in contributing to this repository.
